# Verzeo-July-2021-Minor-Project
This is the minor project I made on google Collaboratory for the Verzeo onboarding classes for Introduction To Machine Learning with Python.
The dataset has been provided in an excel sheet in CSV format. The project was done on Google Collaboratory using basics of Machine Learning with Python.
A PDF has been attached which helps in understanding the project better as it includes the problem statement, tools which were used, why Linear Regression was used,
algorithm explained and a conclusion statement.
